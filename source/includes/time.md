# Time

> To get the milliseconds since application launch, use now().

``` javascript
var now = time.now();
```

> Additionally, you may retrieve the milliseconds since last frame.

```javascript
var dt = time.dt();
```

A very simple time API provides some useful tidbits not included in the [JS Date API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).
